Skill directory: {{skill_dir}}
App checkout: {{target}}. It is read-only: change no file in it, and do not checkout, stash,
or reset it.
Run directory: {{run_dir}}. setup.json holds the facts of this run. Put scratch files in
{{run_dir}}/tmp/{{task_slug}}/.

{{#if bench}}Bench: {{bench}}, Frappe {{framework_version}}. The framework and the apps that the target needs are on
the bench, read-only: {{dependencies}}. Read their source when a verdict depends on what core
does. Change no file in any app on the bench.{{else}}The framework source is not available. Say so when a verdict depends on it.{{/if}}

{{#if inventory}}Inventory: {{inventory}}. It is large, so query it with jq. Its `views` object holds precomputed
lists, and each entry point has its file, line, decorators, parameters, permission checks,
reachable sinks, and a `guard.class` that says how the framework covers it. Start from the views
that narrow to shapes the framework does not guard, such as `unguarded_db_bypass_write`.
`refuted_by_framework` lists entry points that the framework guards, each with `overridable_when`.
`doctypes` holds the permlevel 0 permission rows of each DocType. It is a static approximation:
read the real code before you report or reject.{{else}}No inventory is available. Find candidates with rg.{{/if}}

{{#if semgrep}}Semgrep matches: {{semgrep}}, from the Frappe semgrep rules at {{semgrep_rules}}. Each match has
`rule`, `file`, `line`, and `message`. Query it with jq by `rule`. A match is a candidate, not a
finding.{{else}}No semgrep matches are available. Use the `## Find` section only.{{/if}}

{{#if site}}Test site: {{run_dir}}/site.json. Use it as the "Live test site" section of your conventions says.
Site {{site}}, base URL {{base_url}}.{{#if host_header}} Send the header `Host: {{host_header}}` with every request.{{/if}}
Run server-side code with `bench --site {{site}} execute` from {{bench}}, or over HTTP. Avoid
`bench console`: it can hang on a database lock while other agents write. Never touch another
site on the bench.
Administrator password: {{admin_password}}. Never change it.
Test users for this task:
{{users}}
{{#if slot}}No other agent uses these users while you work. You may change them. The run puts them back
to the state above after your task.{{else}}Other agents use these users at the same time. Never change their roles, password, enabled
flag, or user type. When a proof needs to change a user, create your own user named
`milkshake-{{task_slug}}-...@example.com` and change that one.{{/if}}
{{#if weakens}}This site sets {{weakens}}, and each one weakens a control. A result that occurs only
because of one of these keys is not proved for a normal site.{{/if}}
{{#if site_notes}}{{site_notes}}{{/if}}{{else}}No test site is available. Every claim must come from the code, cited by file and line.{{/if}}
{{#if app_notes}}
{{app_notes}}{{/if}}

Never propose a fix, a patch, or a remediation. The audit reports what is wrong and what it
affects. The fix is the decision of the maintainer, and a wrong suggestion costs more than a
missing one.

Put the marker `milkshake` in all test code that you write, run, or quote: each script, each
`bench execute` or `console` command, each request, each payload, and each record or file that
you create on the test site. Use it in a name, a value, or a comment, for example a record named
`milkshake-po-1`, a parameter value `milkshake' OR 1=1`, or `# milkshake` in a script. The
marker makes each trace of the audit easy to find in site data, logs, and report text. When the
proof needs an exact value that cannot hold the marker, put the marker in a comment or a header
of the same request, for example `X-Audit: milkshake`.

Your result is a file, not a reply. Write it before you finish. The run reads only the file, and
it runs your task again when the file is missing or does not match the format below.
